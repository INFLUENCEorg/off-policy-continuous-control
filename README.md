# CleanRL üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

*Clean implementation of **model-free** deep RL algorithms using both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.*

*As a side project of mine, this repo has a strong focus on helping learners like me.*

*This project was inpsired by OpenAI Spinning Up, which helped me tremendously along the way.*

## Manifesto

|              Problems with some repos              |                 Solutions                |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| "Code works but I don't understand the how"       | Offers docs and implementation notes                 | 
| Uses sophisticated abstraction                     | Offers graphical explanation of design choices |
|                  Uses one library                  |       Uses both PyTorch and TensorFlow       |
| Does not have a good requirements file             | Has a requirements file tested across multiple machines |
|    Does not compare against authoritative repos    |       Compares against OpenAI Spinning Up*       |
|         Does not test on many environments         |   Tests on many tasks including Mujoco ones  |

\* However, not all algorithms here are implemented in OpenAI Spinning Up.
