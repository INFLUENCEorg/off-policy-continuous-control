# clean-rl
Implementation of important Deep RL algorithms using both PyTorch and TF, with a strong focus on understandable code.

- Model-free
  - Policy optimization (only); see directory `mf-po`
  - Q-learning and policy optimization; see directory `mf-ql-po`
  - Q-learning (only); see directory `mf-ql`
- Model-based (TODO)
