*Minimalistic, well-documented implementation of model-free off-policy deep RL algorithms using PyTorch.*

*This repo implements all algorithms attached to the "Q-learning" node in the diagram below.*

*This project was inpsired by OpenAI Spinning Up, which helped me tremendously along the way.*

## Features

|              Problems with some repos              |                 Solutions                |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| "Code works but I don't understand the how"        | Offers docs and implementation notes                 | 
| Uses sophisticated abstraction                     | Offers graphical explanation of design choices |
| Does not have a good requirements file             | Has a requirements file tested across multiple machines |
|    Does not compare against authoritative repos    |       Compares against OpenAI Spinning Up*       |
|         Does not test on many environments         |   Tests on many tasks including Atari & Mujoco |

\* However, not all algorithms here are implemented in OpenAI Spinning Up.
