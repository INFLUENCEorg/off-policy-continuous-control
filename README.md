# CleanRL

TODO: artwork by Yifei Zhu

*Battle-tested implementation of important Deep RL algorithms using both PyTorch and TensorFlow, with a strong focus on understandable code.*

*Special thanks to the Joshia for creating the OpenAI Spinning Up repo, without which this project would have been impossible.*

## Why this repo?

|              Problems with some repos              |                 Our solutions                |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| Uses sophisticated abstraction without explanation | Uses graphical explanation of design choices |
|                  Uses one library                  |       Uses both PyTorch and TensorFlow       |
| Does not have a good requirements file             | Has a requirements file tested across multiple machines |
|    Does not compare against authoritative repos    |       Compares against OpenAI Spinning Up*       |
|         Does not test on many environments         |   Tests on many tasks including Mujoco ones  |

With these advantages, I hope that testing out new research ideas would be a breeze for you. 

\* However, not all algorithms here are implemented in OpenAI Spinning Up.
