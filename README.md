# Off-policy methods for continuous control üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

*Clean, modular implementation of model-free off-policy methods for continuous control in PyTorch.*

*This repo implements DDPG, TD3 and SAC and tests them against OpenAI Spinning Up's baselines.*

*OpenAI Spinning Up helped me tremendously along the way.*

## Features

|              Problems with some repos              |                 Solutions                |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| "Code works but I don't understand the how"        | Offers docs and implementation notes                 | 
| Uses sophisticated abstraction                     | Offers graphical explanation of design choices |
| Does not have a good requirements file             | Has a requirements file tested across multiple machines |
|    Does not compare against authoritative repos    |       Compares against OpenAI Spinning Up*       |
|         Does not test on many environments         |   Tests on many tasks including Atari & Mujoco |

\* However, not all algorithms here are implemented in OpenAI Spinning Up.

## Codebase design

The diagrams below are created using Lucidchart.

TODO:
- The design of the actor and critic class
  - not meant to be used directly, instantiated within the algorithm
  - Randomness should be handled within algorithm, not actor; even for SAC, the mean and std of Gaussian are outputed by actor, then processed in algorithm
